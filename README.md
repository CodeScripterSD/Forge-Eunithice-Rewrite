A Forge 1.18.2 Minecraft Mod

### Version 0.0.1
###### Note: Every single thing is subject to change
###### Note 2: You will need a lot of resources to progress in this mod.
- Iron, Gold, and Diamond Plates for excessive micro-crafting
- 2 Tiers of hammer used for producing plates and other micro-crafting recipes

  - Iron, Gold, and Diamond (textures subject to change) for extended use in micro-crafting and base-building (If you have the resources to waste)
- 3 Tiers of tools/armor
  - Plated Iron, Plated Gold, Plated Diamond (upgraded from their respective sets and definitely not cheap)
- Set of 4 "Asphalts"
  - Normal 
    - Minor speed increase while walking on it
  - Speed Infused
    - Multiplies your x+z motion while standing on it, creating an effect like ice that makes you move faster (Unless holding sneak)
  - Bounce Infused
    - Increases jump height when jumping from the block
    - Forces the character upwards when moving at "high speeds" (Scales with speed)
  - Honey Infused

    - Reduces fall damage more than a hay block / honey block, but not fully

  - Ender Chest on a Stick
- 5 Foods (All textures likely to change)
  - Leurite Bread
    - Made from Leurite Grains, grown from Leurite Seeds (Knockoff wheat but better but absurdly expensive)
  - Meatball Soup
    - Cooked Mutton, Rabbit Stew, Cooked Chicken, Steak, Cooked Salmon, Cooked Cod, and Cooked Porkchop combined into a disgustingly good concoction
  - Veggie Salad
    - Carrot, Baked Potato, Beetroot soup, and Dried Kelp combined into an oddly flavored delectable
  - Fruit Dish
    - Glow Berries, Sweet Berries, Pumpkin Pie, Melon Slice, and Apple mixed together to make... _something_
  - Revival Sandwich (Name subject to change)
    - The above 4 foods and an Enchanted Golden Apple mixed to form an oddly powerful... sandwich?
